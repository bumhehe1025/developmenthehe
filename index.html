                        learning React was difficult for me. The language was confusing.
                        Days before the deadline, I was cramming in JavaScript and React
                        so I still have a hard time figuring and coming up with the logic for these languages.

                    Throughout the project, my basics and core concepts of JavaScript wasn't there. There were times where
                    I struggle coming up with the logic of my code because I didn't know what functions or components of JS
                    were avaiable to me. For future projects, I will take my time learning the foundational concepts of the 
                    language before jumping straight into it.
